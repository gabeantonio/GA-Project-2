# You're Trippin!

Welcome to You're Trippin, a travel itinerary application.

## Overview 

This application will allow you to plan your upcoming trips. You're able to create up to 7 itineraries per trip (1 itinerary per day, 7 days maximum). For every day of your trip (days 1-7), you are able to add events and activities that you'd like to do when on your trip. If you change your mind, you can edit your itineraries as well. Once you're back from vacation, you can also go ahead and delete the trip you just went on to make room for more. Hooray!
